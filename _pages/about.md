Wellcome to the website of the Wenzel Lab, an interdisciplinary research team headed by Prof. Tobias Wenzel at the Institute of Biological and Medial Engineering at the Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile.

Our research
======
The Wenzel Lab is an interdisciplinary bioengineering research team studying human and environmental microbiomes by developing microfluidic methods for high-throughput multi-omics screens. Our research focuses on in-vitro and single cell analysis (interactions, genomics, cultivation, phenotyping) by drawing on biophysics (self-organisation, micro-and nanostructuration, optics & photonics, modeling) and Open Source Hardware automation.

THIS SITE IS NEW AND UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

But soon there will be more to discover. Visit us again.
