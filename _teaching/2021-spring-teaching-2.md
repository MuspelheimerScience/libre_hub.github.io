This is an interdisciplinary remote grou-work course for students from the Institute for Biological and Medical Engineering.

The course aims to provide students with project management techniques and interdisciplinary team-working
skills that are directly applicable to their future research projects. Students will work in teams to
engage in a practical project requiring input from a variety of scientific areas related to the interface
of engineering, biology and medicine. Project questions will be defined by the multi-disciplinary group of
participating professors who will also be responsible for the direct supervision of the research work
together with external company advisors. At least two professors from a different field supervise each
group.

Students are expected to gain some experience in the various different aspects of group collaboration.
These include running meetings, making collective decisions, time and people management, and writing
reports. Students must combine skills related to the identification and resolution of biomedical problems,
through collaborative design, innovation, use of information technologies, computational modeling, medical
ethics and social responsibility.
